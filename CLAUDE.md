## Memory (Mind)

This project uses Mind for persistent memory across sessions.

### Required Protocol

1. **Session Start**: ALWAYS call `mind_recall()` before responding to the first message.

2. **During Work**: Log actively to SESSION.md (ephemeral) and MEMORY.md (permanent):

   **SESSION.md types - USE FREQUENTLY (cleared between sessions):**
   - `mind_log("reading auth module", type="experience")` - What you're doing NOW
   - `mind_log("can't find token validation", type="blocker")` - What's blocking you
   - `mind_log("tried Redis - overkill", type="rejected")` - What didn't work
   - `mind_log("assuming stable internet", type="assumption")` - What you're assuming

   **MEMORY.md types - For important discoveries:**
   - `mind_log("chose X over Y - simpler", type="decision")`
   - `mind_log("Safari needs vendor prefix", type="learning")`
   - `mind_log("API returns 500 on large payloads", type="problem")`
   - `mind_log("resolved by increasing timeout", type="progress")`

### SESSION.md Logging (IMPORTANT)

**Log to SESSION.md frequently as you work.** This prevents loops - repeating failed fixes, forgetting what you tried.

| When | Type | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Starting a task | `experience` | "investigating login bug" |
| Making an assumption | `assumption` | "assuming user wants client-side validation" |
| Trying an approach | `experience` | "trying Redis for caching" |
| Something didn't work | `rejected` | "Redis too complex for this use case" |
| Getting stuck | `blocker` | "can't find where session is stored" |

**Rule: Log every 2-3 tool calls. If in doubt, log it - SESSION.md clears anyway.**

### Tools Available

- `mind_recall()` - Load context (CALL FIRST!)
- `mind_log(msg, type)` - Log to SESSION.md or MEMORY.md
- `mind_session()` - Check current session state
- `mind_blocker(desc)` - Log blocker + auto-search for solutions
- `mind_search(query)` - Find specific memories
- `mind_remind(msg, when)` - Set reminders

# CLAUDE.md - Instructions for Working With Me

## Communication Style

- **Explain things simply** - I'm not a coder, so avoid technical jargon and break things down in plain English
- **Use the AskUserQuestion tool** to ask as many follow-up questions as needed to fully understand what I want

## Before Building Features

- **Always ask clarifying questions first** - Don't start building until you understand exactly what I need
- **Don't make assumptions** - If something is unclear, ask me rather than guessing
- Ask about:
  - What the feature should do
  - How it should look or behave
  - Any edge cases or special scenarios
  - What success looks like

## When I Paste Errors

- **Just fix them** - Don't ask unnecessary questions, diagnose and solve the problem
- If you truly need more information to fix the error, then ask
- Otherwise, read the error, find the issue, and fix it

## General Guidelines

- Keep explanations short and clear
- Show me what you changed and why (in simple terms)
- If there are multiple ways to solve something, explain the options briefly and let me choose
