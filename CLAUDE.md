# CLAUDE.md - Instructions for Working With Me

## Communication Style

- **Explain things simply** - I'm not a coder, so avoid technical jargon and break things down in plain English
- **Use the AskUserQuestion tool** to ask as many follow-up questions as needed to fully understand what I want

## Before Building Features

- **Always ask clarifying questions first** - Don't start building until you understand exactly what I need
- **Don't make assumptions** - If something is unclear, ask me rather than guessing
- Ask about:
  - What the feature should do
  - How it should look or behave
  - Any edge cases or special scenarios
  - What success looks like

## When I Paste Errors

- **Just fix them** - Don't ask unnecessary questions, diagnose and solve the problem
- If you truly need more information to fix the error, then ask
- Otherwise, read the error, find the issue, and fix it

## General Guidelines

- Keep explanations short and clear
- Show me what you changed and why (in simple terms)
- If there are multiple ways to solve something, explain the options briefly and let me choose
